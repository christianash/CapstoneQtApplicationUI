# CapstoneQtApplicationUI

Open the QML Project file (UntitledProject2) in Qt Design Studio. 

Loading Screens are basically done, some sort of wait mechanic would be good, transition is just middle screen click at the moment. 

Main call page for clear call needs completed popout menues (dialpad, participants, camera in secure) as well as dynamic camera slots (start with one person in call, and camera slots are added after people are called via the dialpad) need to be done before modification is done on either of the secure call screens. This is because the secure screen does much of the same in terms of functionality (especially with popup menus) so it would be easier to do it once and transfer it over to all 3.

Dynamic text at the top of call indicating mute status is also incomplete. Needs to change on mute button press to correctly display mute status.

Dynamic text for participant list needs to use names/numbers of participants in call

Main page design needs to be implemented and similar to the call pages, needs popup menus as well as login/logout considerations?

Main page dialpad needs to display user button input

Security Pages may need some on-screen keyboard and need to hide input text

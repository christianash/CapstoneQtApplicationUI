# CapstoneQtApplicationUI

Open the QML Project file (UntitledProject2) in Qt Design Studio. 

Loading Screens are basically done, some sort of wait mechanic would be good, transition is just middle screen click at the moment. 

Main call page for clear call needs popup menus (volume, dialpad, participants) as well as dynamic camera slots (start with one person in call, and camera slots are added after people are called via the dialpad) need to be done before modification is done on either of the secure call screens. 

Dynamic text at the top of call indicating mute status is also incomplete. 

Main page design needs to be implemented and similar to the call pages, needs popup menus as well as login/logout considerations.
